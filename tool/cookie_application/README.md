# Topic 1: Cookie Consent Visualisation Tool

## Quick Project Description:
Many individuals are not aware what consent means and the implications that follow. One way to ask for consent online is via cookie banners. However, once the consent is given the cookie disappears and one forgets the consent was given in the first place. Retrieving cookie/consent logs is still a challenge even for many individuals with expert knowledge. Extensions for browsers exist but most focus on website sessions (every time a new website is loaded the previously recorded cookies disappear from the logs). There is no clear and easily accessible information about the amount of consents one gave when it comes to cookies.

Idea: Export cookies from a browser (e.g. Chrome via existing extensions such as "Get cookies.txt" or export .har files) and store them in a knowledge graph. Create a personalised interface that allows a user to see the cookies they gave during the day. Filter information based on the type of cookies, websites, time, etc.Â 
Main goal: Raise awareness about data sharing by showing individuals how many cookies and consent they gave for a period of time.
